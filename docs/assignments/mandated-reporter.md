# Mandated Reporter Training
## California State Law and UC Policy

- California requires all individuals interacting with K-12 students (volunteers) to complete a mandated reporter training.
- This training protects students from domestic violence, child abuse, and other harms that may be inflicted upon them outside or inside of the classroom.
- If you see something, say something.
- UCSD has two e-learning modules that will satisfy this requirement for all of you.
