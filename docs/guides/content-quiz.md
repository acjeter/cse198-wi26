# Content Quiz

For **Outreach lessons**, you must demonstrate knowledge of the material before teaching it if you aren't a creator of the lesson. This is to ensure that all event attendees are able to effectively teach the material, or answer questions to the K-12 students if asked.

You must pass the content quiz **at least 1 day before** the event, in order to be assigned a ride.

> If you do not pass the quiz by the deadline, you will not be **assigned a ride** and may not be able to attend the event. If you do attend regardless, you will not be checked off for the event until the content quiz is completed.

## How to Take It
1. The quiz link will be posted in event listing on the HKN Portal, in addition to being resent in the **Discord** `#ride` thread for the specific event.
2. It is a short google form (three-five questions).
3. There are unlimited attempts, so don't worry if you don't pass the first time.
