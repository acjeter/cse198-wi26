# Ride Scheduling

Most outreach events are off-campus. We provide transportation from UCSD.

## How it Works
1. **RSVP:** Sign up on the Portal.
2. **Assignment:** Rides are assigned roughly **24-48 hours** before the event.
3. **Notification:** You will be pinged on **Discord** with your driver and pickup time.
4. **Pickup Location:** Usually the **Warren Bear** or **Peterson Loop**. Check Discord for exact details.

## Drivers
If you are a driver:
- You will receive extra points/credit.
- Ensure you have a valid license and insurance.
