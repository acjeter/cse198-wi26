# Ride Scheduling & Reimbursement Process

Most outreach events are off-campus. To help volunteers attend, we **coordinate optional volunteer carpools** from UCSD to the event site.

If you prefer not to ride in another volunteer’s personal vehicle, you can **arrange your own transportation** and still participate.

## How it Works
1. **RSVP:** Sign up on the Portal.
2. **Coordination:** Carpools are coordinated roughly **24–48 hours** before the event through the `#rides` channel on Discord. If demand exceeds available seats, priority is typically based on RSVP time.
3. **Notification:** You will be pinged on **Discord** with your driver and pickup time. Please react to the message to confirm your attendance. If you do not react, **your ride spot may be reassigned** if needed.
4. **Pickup Location:** Usually **Pepper Canyon Hall Loop** or **Price Center Loop**. Check the ride thread for exact details.

## Drivers
Drivers are fellow student volunteers using their **personal vehicles**.

**Driver eligibility:**
- Must be **18+**
- Must have a valid driver’s license
- Must have proof of legally required insurance

> By volunteering to drive, you confirm you meet the requirements above and will follow all traffic laws and safe-driving practices. As an operator of a motor vehicle, you are responsible for the safe operation of your vehicle and compliance with all laws. **Any mileage reimbursement administered through UC San Diego and the ECE department is simply an expense reimbursement and does not change your responsibility for safely operating your vehicle**.

## Mileage Reimbursement (ECE/HKN Process)
For school-required outreach events, HKN (via the ECE department) may reimburse eligible student drivers for mileage **through the official UC San Diego reimbursement process**.

**Reimbursement Basics:**
- Reimbursement is intended to **offset travel expenses** (not to provide a transportation service).
- Rates and required documentation are determined by the **UC San Diego Reimbursement Policy**.

**Reimbursement Steps:**
1. **Drive Assignment:** Confirm you are listed as a driver in the event’s `#rides` channel on Discord.
2. **Initiate the Reimbursement Process:**
    A. Visit the [Reimbursement Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lRAv_VujvlaihkNM_S2ZoC6I5I3ILAFhcfwSO46bo6Y/edit?usp=drive_link) and follow the instructions to fill it out.
    B. Ensure you have MULTIPLE FORMS for each SCHOOL LOCATION driven to. 
        i. For example, if you drive to two different schools, visiting School A 3 times and School B 2 times, you will need to submit two separate reimbursement forms. One for School A, with 3 dates, and one for School B, with 2 dates.
    C. Send these forms to the CSE Outreach Chair via email or Discord DM.
3. **Submission Deadline:** Submit your reimbursement forms before the conclusion of the quarter.
